# Asphalt

Asphalt is a simple CLI tool used to upload assets to Roblox and easily reference them in code.

## Features

-   Upload images, SVGs, sounds, models, and animations to Roblox
-   Generate Luau code to reference the uploaded assets
-   Generate Typescript definitions for roblox-ts users
-   Uses the Open Cloud API
-   Supports uploading to groups
-   Define existing uploaded assets, so all of your stuff can be referenced in one place
-   Alpha bleeds images for crisp edges when scaled

## Installation

### Aftman

```sh
aftman add jacktabscode/asphalt
```

### Cargo

```sh
cargo install asphalt
```

## Commands

### `asphalt init`

Guides you through setting up a new Asphalt project in the current directory.

### `asphalt sync`

Uploads all assets in the `asset_dir` to Roblox. It will also generate a `asphalt.lock.toml` file which you should commit to source control.

### `asphalt list`

Lists asset paths from the lockfile and their corresponding Roblox asset IDs.

## Configuration

Asphalt is configured with a project file called `asphalt.toml`. It is required for the program to run.

<summary>Example</summary>

```toml
asset_dir = "test/"
write_dir = "output/"

[codegen]
typescript = true
luau = true
style = "flat"
output_name = "assets"

[creator]
type = "user"
id = 9670971

[existing]
"test/some_sound_on_roblox.ogg" = { id = 123456789 }
"test/some_image_on_roblox.png" = { id = 987654321 }
```

</details>

### Format

-   `asset_dir`: path
    -   The directory of assets to upload to Roblox.
-   `write_dir`: path
    -   The directory to output the generated code to. This should probably be somewhere in your game's source folder.
-   `creator`: Creator
    -   The Roblox creator to upload the assets under.
-   `codegen`: Codegen
    -   Code generation options.
-   `existing`: map<string, ExistingAsset> (optional)

#### Creator

-   `type`: "user" or "group"
-   `id`: number

#### Codegen

-   `typescript`: boolean (optional)
    -   Generate a Typescript definition file.
-   `luau`: boolean (optional)
    -   Use the `luau` file extension.
-   `style`: "flat" | "nested" (optional)
    -   The code-generation style to use. Defaults to `flat`. If you would like to have an experience similar to [Tarmac](https://github.com/rojo-rbx/tarmac), use `nested`.
-   `output_name`: string (optional)
    -   The name for the generated files. Defaults to `assets`.
-   `strip_extension`: boolean (optional)
    -   Whether to strip the file extension. Defaults to `false`. If you would like to have an experience similar to [Tarmac](https://github.com/rojo-rbx/tarmac), use `true`.

#### ExistingAsset

-   `id`: number

## API Key

You will need an API key to sync with Asphalt. You can specify this using the `--api-key` argument, or the `ASPHALT_API_KEY` environment variable.

You can get one from the [Creator Dashboard](https://create.roblox.com/dashboard/credentials). Make sure you select the correct group and Asset-related permissions.

## Cookie
You will need a cookie to upload animations to Roblox. This is because the Open Cloud API does not support them. You can specify this using the `--cookie` argument, or the `ASPHALT_COOKIE` environment variable.

You will probably want to [disable Session Protection](https://create.roblox.com/settings/advanced) if you are using Asphalt in an environment where your IP address changes frequently.

## Animations

> [!WARNING]
> This feature is experimental, and Roblox may break the API we use or change its behavior without warning.

To upload animations, make sure you specify a cookie as noted above.

Asphalt expects a single [KeyframeSequence](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/KeyframeSequence) to be saved as either a `.rbxm` or `.rbxmx` file.
